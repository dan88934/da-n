    long_description_text2:'After finishing the tutorial, I then went on to compile the React code using webpack, which was a useful learning experience.',
    long_description_text3:'I then created a backend server with Golang, utilizing the Gin web framework. This was my first time using Golang and Gin. I used a catch-all solution to handle the routing, directing all the relevant routes to index.html.',
